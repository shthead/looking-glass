# Looking Glass

Easy to deploy Looking Glass made in PHP.

This is a fork of the original looking-glass project located here: https://github.com/respawner/looking-glass

The differences in this fork are:

* More sensible defaults for the text boxes (if you have lots of routers)
* Added support for VyOS
* Added commands for show bgp/show route (show route was already there but it was named BGP)

## Requirements

  * Webserver such as Apache 2, or Lighttpd, etcâ€¦
  * PHP (>= 5.2.0) module for the webserver (mod-php5 for Apache 2 for example)

## Description

This web application made in PHP is what we call a **Looking Glass**. This is a
tool used to get some information about networks by giving the opportunity to
execute some commands on routers. The output is sent back to the user.

For now this looking glass is quite simple. Here you have some features:

  * Interface using Javascript and AJAX calls (needs a decent browser)
  * Support of BIRD, Cisco, Juniper and Quagga routers
  * Support of Telnet and SSH connection to routers using password
    authentication and SSH keys.
  * Configurable list of routers
  * Tweakable interface (title, logo, footer, elements order)
  * Log all commands in a file
  * Customizable output with regular expressions

And here is a list of what this looking glass should be able to do in the
future:

  * Support more routers
  * Support of other types of authentication
  * Configurable list of allowed commands

## Configuration

Copy the configuration **config.php.example** file to create a **config.php**
file. It contains all the values (PHP variables) used to customize the looking
glass.

## Documentation

An up-to-date (hopefully) documentation is available in the **docs/**
directory. It gives enough details to setup the looking glass, to configure it
and to prepare your routers.
